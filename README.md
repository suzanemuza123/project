# project
Hello this is Suzane Muza
Information:
This project is about my mobile app/website for easy and healthy Take N Bake Pizza
The app is geared towards families who want to eat healthy pizzas as a family. We cater to people who are foodies but also health conscious. We even have vegan options
You would come into a store or order on the mobile site  and pick up in the store and take the pizza home and enjoy!
You pick all the fresh ingredients and customize the pizza the way you like.
We list allergies and gluten levels in food and label vegan/vegatarin items.
Technologies:
HTML
CSS
Javascript
Visual Studio Code
Ideas for future improvements:
Later I want to work on getting pizza delivered to homes.
Or doing like a Hello Fresh type of thing, we send a kit with pizza,cheese, wine or something
Adding in a membership system
